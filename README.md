# PolyPop-SceneSource
Render a scene as an image source to use as textures for other things

## Installation

Plop this as a folder in `%AppData%\PolyPop\Plugins` I named it `scene-source`

## Usage

In the library add a `Scene Source` which will appear in the `Subscenes` section of it. Click `Edit` and that will open an editor for you to add whatever to.

Once you've set up the subscene, select some object which takes a texture and pick the new scene source.
